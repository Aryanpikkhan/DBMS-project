We have created a website for a wildlife sanctuary trip. In this website we schedule appointments for enthusiastic people to visit sanctuary. We have created a database management system to for a national park and wildlife sanctuary authority so that admin can schedule trips for enthusiastic people. Here wildlife enthusiasts can register for a trip and select desired package. The admin can schedule and plan the trip according to available dates. We have used MySQL as the Database Management System to access, maintain and update the above-mentioned data. The backend primarily contains PHP. Also, we have used HTML and CSSâ€ƒ
